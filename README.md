</> Hi there! Houda here 🌝. and I am an astrophysics PhD student at Newcastle University. My research interest lies within understanding how supermassive black holes evolve with their host galaxies. 
</> 💻 I code in Python & C. I love coding both for academia purposes and for fun little personal projects such as building a website or writing code to organise my laptop desktop! Coding saves me so much time &makes my life so much easier 
</> If you would like to discuss my code, or just want to learn more about my work, feel free to contact me.
