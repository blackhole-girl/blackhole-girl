- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Houda Haidar, and I am an astrophysics PhD student.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational Physics, using C and Python 3. Specifically, my work evolves around  analysing, optimizing and visualising astrophysics data.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently self-learning tiny Machine Learning using Python and C++ scripting through a HarvardX online class.
- Here I share code I have worked on as part of my university + internship projects, as well as some scripts that I wrote for fun. 
- If you notice any mistakes in my code, or if you would just like to reach out,  please feel free to contact me
